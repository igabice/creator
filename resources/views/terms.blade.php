{{--                            <p class="mb-3">We thought we would build a system where young people don’t prey on one another’s need for money and desperation. That we could actually build a system that catered for everything lacking in our nurture or  the education system that produced most of us. Now there is actually a platform where true value can be exchanged and everyone is 7 digits better for it.</p>--}}


                            <p>This 7dc.ng - A platform built for and owned by The Affiliates Limited of The 7D Group</p>

                            <p>
                                There are three main functions this web app offers;
                                1. To Promote and sell (as an Affiliate) other peoples’ Products (such as Courses, Skill Learning, Ebooks, Membership, Conference Tickets or access, etc).

                                2. To buy, learn and or use any of these products as a Client or Consumer or Customer (and any of the other Cs that is relevant to this discourse).

                                3. To put up your product for sale (as a Creator) and for promotion by the independent affiliates.
                            </p>

                            <p>When you sign up, you agree to become a member of the 7dc.ng community.</p>

                            <p>To all of these wonderful ends, it is imperative to lay some ground rules and some very good understanding. We must all understand ourselves if we must have a beautiful experience using this platform.</p>

                            <p>
                                This platform does no kind of background check on affiliates. We are not suspecting anyone. We give everyone who signs up our trust and the burden to live up to that trust.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                What this means is that we have no control and therefore no guarantee on what they will say or do when they are promoting your products. Should they grow overzealous in their marketing and promise what your product (s) does not do, it is not on us. We are indemnified. We will not be refunding money to anybody or on anyone’s behalf including our humble self.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you are buying a course or any other products on this platform, please know that we offer no guarantee on what the course will do for you. Neither do we have any guarantee for the course creator’s integrity. However, when you drop reviews at the end of the course, it will help us to know what and what products to keep on or to remove from the platform.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Invariably, dear course creator, you have heard it up there. But let’s make it clearer. We are saying that signing up on this platform means you understand that we have the right to remove your products from the people’s views anytime, without recourse to how you feel. Naturally, no creator will feel good about their product(s) being removed, but we hope you understand that we have to do what is best for the majority.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                When you buy or pay for anything on this platform there will be no refund, please expect none. The monies received on this platform mostly goes to the affiliates and the creators.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you as a creator by himself gives any money-back guarantee, then such creator will have to be responsible for the total refund due to such client’s requests.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Should any misunderstanding or grievances ensue from a creator to client interaction? The 7D Affiliates Limited of The 7D Group will take any libel or slander on 7dc.ng very likely. We will pursue you with a lawsuit and know that when you sign up on this platform, you have agreed that you will be responsible for paying the total fees of retaining the services of any lawyer who represents us according to his bill and practice.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Let us repeat the last clause, please don’t slander or defame our character because you feel bad about a product you bought on our platform. The decision to buy was yours and the product was created by someone that isn’t us. If you slander us or defame our character or spoil our reputation, we will come at you with a lawsuit and it is you who will still pay our lawyer for her services.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                But seriously, are we saying we don’t want to be responsible? No way. We are a very responsible organization. Simply file a formal complaint about the course or creator via your dashboard and you will see us swing into action before the end of 48 hours from receipt of your complaint.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                We are building a very competitive platform, we would like to give everyone the kind of value they won’t get anywhere else. To this end, should we find out that our creators’ courses hosted on other platforms are more affordable than it is on our platform, we will be forced to bring such creators courses to a published discount offer. If you sign up on this platform, it means you have given us an irrevocable consent to do so. And we will be the one to decide how much discount is competitive.
                            </p>

                                In the beginning, only the admin will be able to remove or delete courses as soon as creators can do so, we will notify every member of the community via email. Even when courses are deleted, the people who already paid for the courses will still have access to it for a communicated stipulated period of time.
                            </p>
                            <p>
