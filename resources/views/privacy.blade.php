{{--                            <p class="mb-3">We thought we would build a system where young people don’t prey on one another’s need for money and desperation. That we could actually build a system that catered for everything lacking in our nurture or  the education system that produced most of us. Now there is actually a platform where true value can be exchanged and everyone is 7 digits better for it.</p>--}}


                            <p>Okay, so when we were creating 7dc.ng all we had in mind was to create a platform where everyone can succeed. We wanted you to make a lot of legitimate money via selling or creating or learning high-income skills and valuable courses.</p>

                            <p>
                                However we are not foolish, we know we should protect ourselves. Even when we mean well for ourselves; lawsuits never do.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The idea is that you will agree to these working arrangements related to how this platform works. We don’t want to bicker and argue about what is and what is not.
                                Hence the reason we are putting this together for you in clear terms and not in a lawyer’s gibberish.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Normally, you can’t sign up on this platform without dropping your verified email address and WhatsApp number.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This means that in a short while, as things go according to plan, we will have a lot of people’s data and bio information as profiles are updated on the platform.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Now, we are telling you we will have to use this information to market more people like you. You know our marketing efforts have to be consistent. We also assure you that we will not use the information in any way to hurt you. We will never at any point be asking you for your BVN or Debit card Pin.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This means that you are saying that we are free to send you promotional content from 7dc.ng and from all company members (i.e. Subsidiaries) of The 7D Group or our partners. Promotional contents such as emails, SMS, WhatsApp messages and DMs across all your social media. Okay, thank you so much.

                                And yes, you will be able to unsubscribe from our mailing lists in case you find us burdensome (abi, na promotional messages we call am, no be witchcraft). But seriously, we don’t think you will be bored of us, we are that interestingly sweet.
