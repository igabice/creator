                            <p>
                                We couldn’t sit around anymore and watch the whole financial system go down in shambles. We had to do something about it. The middle class is fast disappearing and it behoves on us Millenials and Gen Zs to lift our generation out of poverty into a meaningful life. One that is not ridden with tragedy or the misery of scarcity.
                            </p>
                            <p class="mb-3">We thought we would build a system where young people don’t prey on one another’s need for money and desperation. That we could actually build a system that catered for everything lacking in our nurture or  the education system that produced most of us. Now there is actually a platform where true value can be exchanged and everyone is 7 digits better for it.</p>
                            <p>
                                We built this platform so that men may stay at home more and get to be around for a quality time to raise well-balanced  and adapted children. We built this platform so women can love their husbands better. We raised 7dc.ng so that young people can grow into blissful adults.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="about-txt">
                            <p>
                                We created this platform so that those of us who have found light, may with love guide the rest of us to liberation. This is financial freedom, to be free to love genuinely and to live life on our own terms. We built this platform to make the world a better place.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We know we could create a web App where people can learn high income skills, get insights, strategies and frameworks that gets them making 7 digits every month. And we know that naturally the  persons who help other persons make 7 digits monthly will also definitely make 7 digits every month.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is 7dc.ng a one stop platform where affiliates will link upwardly mobile people with creators who will help them with skills, courses and many more. This is part of our ongoing plan to raise seven million millionaires by the year 2028 across Africa.
                                We have made it as simple as ABC [<b>Affiliates</b> helping <b>Buyers</b> access value from <b>Creators</b>].
